/**
 * inits the jSignature widget
 * Arguments vary per command. When provided, command is expected to be a string with a command for jSignature. Commands supported at this time: init, reset, getData, setData, listPlugins
 * \@summary 
 * init is the default, assumed action. init takes one argument - a settings Object. You can omit the command and just pass the settings object in upon init. Returns (in a traditional jQuery chainable way) jQuery object ref to the element onto which the plugin was applied.
 * clear (also aliased as reset) clears the signature pad, data store (and puts back signature line and other decor). Returns (in a traditional jQuery chainable way) jQuery object ref to the element onto which the plugin was applied.
 * getData takes an argument - the name of the data format. Returns a data object appropriate for the data format.
 * setData (also aliased as importData) takes two arguments - data object, (optional) data format name. When data object is a string formatted in data-url pattern you don't need to specify the data dormat name. The data format name (mime) will be implied from the data-url prefix. Returns (in a traditional jQuery chainable way) jQuery object ref to the element onto which the plugin was applied.
 * listPlugins takes an argument - a string denoting the category (Only export, import supported at this time) of plugins to list. Returns an array of strings.
