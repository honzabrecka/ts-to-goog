/**
 * You can either switch the whole page or a single HTML element to fullscreen mode
 * This only works when the code was triggered by a user interaction (For example a onclick event on a button). Browsers don't allow entering fullscreen mode without user interaction.
 * Fullscreen mode is always exited via the document but this plugin allows it also via any HTML element. The owner document of the selected HTML element is used
 * The method returns the current fullscreen element (or true if browser doesn't support this) when fullscreen mode is active,
 * false if not active or null when the browser does not support fullscreen mode at all
 * @param {boolean=} fullScreen
 * @return {(boolean|?<!HTMLElement>)|boolean}
